        "title": "Which tourist attraction in your city would you recommend to your colleagues?",
        "content": "If I were to recommend a tourist attraction in my city, Hangzhou, to my colleagues, I would definitely suggest the West Lake. I have lived here for a while, and it is a place I often go to when I need to relax. First, the West Lake is not just a lake; it is the heart and soul of Hangzhou. What impresses me most is its rich cultural heritage. For centuries, it has been a source of inspiration for poets and artists. It is a very peaceful and inspiring experience. Second, it is incredibly convenient to get to. No matter where my colleagues are in the city, they can easily reach the West Lake. This makes it a very practical choice, especially for visitors who have limited time. Finally, after enjoying the lake, there are other interesting places to explore nearby. For example, they could visit Leifeng Tower to get a wonderful view of the entire lake, or go to Longjing Village to learn about Chinese tea culture. It is a great way to have a full day of sightseeing and relaxation. I am sure my colleagues would have an amazing and memorable experience."

        "title": "Do you like making plans?",
        "content": "Yes, I do like making plans. First, making plans gives me a sense of control and security. When I have a plan, I feel more prepared and confident, whether it is for a major project at work or a simple weekend trip. For example, if I have a day off, I would plan to visit West Lake. This way, I can make the most of my time and avoid feeling lost or overwhelmed. Second, planning helps me to be more efficient and productive. By breaking down a large task into smaller, manageable steps, I can focus on one thing at a time and track my progress. This is especially important at work, where I often deal with complex projects. A clear plan helps me stay organized and ensures that I meet my deadlines. Finally, I find the process of planning itself enjoyable. It is a creative process that allows me to be proactive. For instance, when I plan a family dinner, I enjoy thinking about the menu, buying the ingredients, and cooking for my loved ones. The plan is not just about the food, but also about creating a happy and memorable experience for everyone."

        "title": "Are you busier now than when you were a student?",
        "content": "Yes, I am definitely busier now than when I was a student. My responsibilities have grown significantly. First, my work requires a lot of my time and energy. As a student, my main focus was on studying. Now, I have to manage complex projects and meet strict deadlines. This often means I have to work long hours, which makes me feel much more occupied. Second, I have more responsibilities in my personal life. For example, I enjoy cooking for my family, which is a rewarding but time-consuming activity. I need to plan meals, go to the supermarket, and spend time in the kitchen. As a student, I had fewer of these daily life responsibilities. My schedule was more flexible. Now, my free time is more limited, and I have to make plans carefully to have a good rest, like planning a visit to West Lake. In conclusion, because of the combination of a demanding job and more personal life duties, I am much busier now than I was in my student years."

        "content": "I use social media, especially WeChat, for a few specific purposes that I find very enjoyable and useful.

        "content": "Yes, I am a big fan of making shopping lists. For me, it is mainly about being efficient and staying organized. Just like I plan my work projects, I plan my shopping. With a list, my visit to the supermarket is much more effective. I can gather all the fresh ingredients for a family dinner without forgetting any key items. This saves me from the hassle of a second trip. Another major benefit is that a list helps me manage my budget. It is easy to be tempted by special offers. A list helps me stick to what I actually need. Finally, I find real pleasure in the process of creating the list. It feels like the first creative step of cooking a meal. It gets me thinking about the delicious food I will prepare for my family. So for me, a shopping list is a simple habit that makes my life a little bit easier."

        "title": "What apps have you recently used?",
        "content": "In my daily life, I find a few apps are very important for handling both my work and personal life. I would like to talk about three of them. First, for my work, Lark is really important. I have to manage complex projects with tight deadlines, and Lark is the main tool our team uses to work together. For example, we can edit documents together in real time and manage all our tasks in one place. This ensures that everyone is on the same page, which is very important for being productive and meeting our goals. It makes our work process much smoother and helps us avoid misunderstandings. For my personal life, WeChat is the app I use the most to keep in touch with people. It is more than just for sending messages; it is how I stay close to my family and friends. Sharing moments, like pictures of a meal I have cooked, or having a quick video call, helps to close the distance and makes our relationships stronger. It is very important for my social life. Finally, for everyday tasks, I use Amap. Its accurate maps and real-time traffic information are very helpful for getting around the city efficiently, which saves me a lot of time. So, to sum up, these three apps work together: Lark for work efficiency, WeChat for personal connections, and Amap for daily travel. Together, they help me keep my life organized and balanced."

        "title": "What do you do when you spend time alone?",
        "content": "When I have some free time, I like to visit places with beautiful nature and interesting culture. It is a good way for me to relax and get my energy back. For example, I am planning a trip by myself to West Lake in Hangzhou. I would like to start my day by walking around the lake. The beautiful views would help me feel peaceful. I have heard that the views are very beautiful in the morning. After that, I plan to visit Leifeng Tower. I am very interested in its history and the famous story about it. Seeing it in real life would be a great experience and help me learn about the local culture. In the afternoon, I would go to Longjing Village. I like tea very much, and Longjing tea is a famous green tea in China. I would like to walk through the tea fields, see how people make the tea, and of course, drink a fresh cup of it. This would be a very peaceful time, and I could enjoy the simple things in life. So, to sum up, spending my time alone on a trip like this is not about being lonely. It is about enjoying the quiet time, seeing nature and history, and learning new things slowly. It helps me have a good balance in my life and makes me very happy."

        "title": "Do you stay up late? Why?",
        "content": "Yes, I sometimes stay up late, although I try not to make it a habit. It usually happens for a couple of main reasons, related to my work and my personal time. First, I sometimes need to work late to meet tight deadlines. I am often involved in complex projects, and occasionally I need some extra quiet hours in the evening to finish my work. This helps to ensure everything stays on track and we can meet our project goals. The quiet environment at night really helps me to focus without distractions. The second reason is to have some personal time to relax. After a long and busy day, I find it is very important to have some time for myself. During this time, I like to read a book or listen to some calm music. This is my way to relax and get my energy back. It is a peaceful time that helps me keep my life balanced. Of course, I understand that staying up late is not very healthy, and I can feel tired the next morning. So, I try my best to get enough sleep most nights. To sum up, I stay up late when I have to, either for work or for myself, but I always try to find a healthy balance."
