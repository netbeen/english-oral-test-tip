        "title": "Which tourist attraction in your city would you recommend to your colleagues?",
        "content": "If I were to recommend a tourist attraction in my city, Hangzhou, to my colleagues, I would definitely suggest the West Lake. I have lived here for a while, and it is a place I often go to when I need to relax. First, the West Lake is not just a lake; it is the heart and soul of Hangzhou. What impresses me most is its rich cultural heritage. For centuries, it has been a source of inspiration for poets and artists. For example, the famous poet Su Dongpo wrote many beautiful poems about the lake, and when you are there, you can almost feel the history around you. It is a very peaceful and inspiring experience. Second, it is incredibly convenient to get to. No matter where my colleagues are staying in the city, they can easily reach the West Lake within an hour. This makes it a very practical choice, especially for visitors who have limited time. Finally, after enjoying the lake, there are other interesting places to explore nearby. For example, they could visit Leifeng Tower to get a wonderful view of the entire lake, or go to Longjing Village to see the tea fields and learn about Chinese tea culture. It is a great way to have a full day of sightseeing and relaxation. I am sure my colleagues would have an amazing and memorable experience."

        "content": "If I had a day off tomorrow, I would plan a day that combines relaxation and family connection. My first choice would be to visit West Lake, which is very accessible since I live in Hangzhou. I would go in the morning to enjoy the tranquility. West Lake is not just a scenic spot; it is the heart and soul of Hangzhou, rich with cultural heritage. I would take a slow walk along the causeway, enjoying the fresh air and the beautiful scenery. Seeing the calm water and the green hills always helps me to de-stress and clear my mind, taking me away from the pressures of work. After spending a few hours there, feeling refreshed, I would head to a local market to buy some fresh ingredients. I find a lot of joy in cooking, and I would love to prepare a special meal for my family. The process of choosing the food, cooking, and then sharing the meal together is the perfect way to end a relaxing day. It is a simple pleasure, but it brings me a great sense of happiness and connection with my loved ones."

        "title": "Do you like making plans?",
        "content": "Yes, I do like making plans, for several reasons. First, making plans gives me a sense of control and security. When I have a plan, I feel more prepared and confident, whether it is for a major project at work or a simple weekend trip. For example, if I have a day off, I would plan to visit West Lake. I would think about what time to go, how to get there, and what to do afterwards. This way, I can make the most of my time and avoid feeling lost or overwhelmed. Second, planning helps me to be more efficient and productive. By breaking down a large task into smaller, manageable steps, I can focus on one thing at a time and track my progress. This is especially important at work, where I often deal with complex projects. A clear plan helps me stay organized and ensures that I meet my deadlines. Finally, I find the process of planning itself enjoyable. I like thinking about the future and imagining the different possibilities. It is a creative process that allows me to be proactive and shape my own experiences. For instance, when I plan a family dinner, I enjoy thinking about the menu, buying the ingredients, and cooking for my loved ones. The plan is not just about the food, but also about creating a happy and memorable experience for everyone."

        "title": "Are you busier now than when you were a student?",
        "content": "Yes, I am definitely busier now than when I was a student. My life has changed in several ways, and my responsibilities have grown significantly. First, my work requires a lot of my time and energy. As a student, my main focus was on studying and completing assignments. Now, I have to manage complex projects and meet strict deadlines. This often means I have to work long hours and I am always thinking about my work tasks, which makes me feel much more occupied. Second, I have more responsibilities in my personal life. For example, I enjoy cooking for my family, which is a rewarding but time-consuming activity. I need to plan meals, go to the supermarket, and spend time in the kitchen. As a student, I had fewer of these daily life responsibilities. My schedule was more flexible, and I had long vacations to relax and pursue my hobbies. Now, my free time is more limited, and I have to make plans carefully to have a good rest, like planning a visit to West Lake. In conclusion, because of the combination of a demanding job and more personal life duties, I am much busier now than I was in my student years."

        "content": "I use social media, especially WeChat, for a few specific purposes that I find very enjoyable and useful. It is a great tool for me to share my life and connect with people I care about. First, I use WeChat to share my passion for food and cooking. I really enjoy preparing meals for my family, and I often take pictures of the dishes I make. Sometimes, I also document the cooking process itself, from buying fresh ingredients at the supermarket to the final presentation of the meal. I post these pictures and stories on my WeChat Moments. It is a way for me to keep a record of my culinary creations and share my happiness with friends and family. Many of them enjoy seeing my posts and it often starts interesting conversations about recipes and cooking techniques. Second, I use WeChat to stay in touch with my family and friends, especially those who live far away. In today's busy world, it is not always easy to meet in person. WeChat provides a convenient way to communicate and share updates. We can have video calls, send messages, and see what everyone is up to through their posts. It helps me feel connected to my loved ones, no matter the distance. In conclusion, I mainly use social media to share my personal interests like cooking and to maintain my relationships with family and friends. It is a simple but meaningful part of my daily life."

        "title": "Do you like making a list when you go shopping? Why?",
        "content": "Yes, I am a big fan of making shopping lists. For me, it is mainly about being efficient and staying organized. Just like I plan my work projects, I plan my shopping. With a list, my visit to the supermarket is much more effective. I can gather all the fresh ingredients for a family dinner without forgetting any key items. This saves me from the hassle of a second trip. Another major benefit is that a list helps me manage my budget. It is easy to be tempted by special offers and make impulse buys. A list helps me stick to what I actually need. Finally, I find real pleasure in the process of creating the list. It feels like the first creative step of cooking a meal. It gets me thinking about the delicious food I will prepare for my family. So for me, a shopping list is a simple habit that makes my shopping trips more focused and my life a little bit easier."
